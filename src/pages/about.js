      <h2>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>My name is Bernadette and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer currently living in Toronto, ON.</p>
      <p>I graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Science at UofT and have recently pivoted into a career in technology after graduating from the Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs.</p>
      <p>I love learning new things, hence why I turned to web development! As a creative, I learned coding to make my design ideas functional. Aside from biology and coding, I sometimes teach English online to Japanese students.</p>
      <p>I also love to draw, write about self growth, create motion graphics, and play music!</p>
      <p>If you'd like to know more about me, you can find my contact info <Link to="/contact">here.</Link></p>
