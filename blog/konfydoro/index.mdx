## A comfy, cute, simple customizeable pomodoro timer for productivity purposes.


_Konfydoro was created as a personal project to help with studying and other productive tasks._

### Tech stack:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, React, Theme Builder, Styled Components

<div data-sal="fade"
        data-sal-duration="1000"
        data-sal-delay="200"
        data-sal-easing="ease" className="workInfoTwo">

## Origin: 
The idea to create this app came from the simple desire of wanting a cute and customizeable pomodoro timer. It is branded and themed with original characters created by myself and a close friend of mine.
Konfydoro serves as a way to express myself and delve deeper into react and styled components!

## Features: 
Konfydoro allows you to choose between two current themes (possible functionality to create your own theme to come in the future, as well as SFX). Users can also 
customize the work, short, and long break timers to their liking. Users can also pause and start the timer whenever needed.

## Reflections: 
This project allowed me to learn a lot more about styled components and creating themes using theme builder in react. Exploring these two topics really made me
realize how much more finnicky regular CSS is. This is the first personal application I've completed and deployed and it really gave me the confidence to
explore just what I could make with my evergrowing coding skillset!
