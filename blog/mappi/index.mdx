## Origin: 
During our midterm at Lighthouse Labs, we were tasked with creating an application within a week based on some topics to choose from. We decided
to choose a WikiMaps application that allowed users to create maps collaboratively using a maps API. 

## Features: 
Mappi uses the Google Maps API with Node and Express. Users can
search input a category and location and the map will be populated with points corresponding to the search. 
Users can then add those points to a map.

## Reflections: 
This project challenged me and my team members to learn two new libraries in a short amount of time: KonvaJS and Socket.IO. This was also the first real
application we built from the ground up with React and Express. It was challenging to implement the save feature, as we needed a way to have every item on the board
save properly into our database.
