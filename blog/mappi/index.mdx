## Origin: 
During our midterm at Lighthouse Labs, we were tasked with creating an application within a week based on some topics to choose from. We decided
to choose a WikiMaps application that allowed users to create maps collaboratively using a maps API. 

## Features: 
Mappi uses the Google Maps API with Node and Express. Users can
search input a category and location and the map will be populated with points corresponding to the search. 
Users can then add those points to a map.

## Reflections: 
This project challenged me and my team members to learn a challenging API -- the Google Maps API. It was the first experience we encountered with an API Of our choice
and having to learn, understand and implement it in a week's time was challenging, but rewarding. This was also the first experience we had in a team setting,
and being able to coordinate and learn from one another was also a challenge. Special thanks to Bles M. and Walid D. for being incredible teammates!
