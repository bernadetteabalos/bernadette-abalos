## Origin: 
As part of the Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp, during our final project we were tasked with building an application of our choosing in less than two weeks time.
With the increasing shift into a remote working world, our team chose to build a collaborative online whiteboard application.

## Features: 
Hodo uses the KonvaJS library to generate different shapes, text, images, and even directly draw on a canvas. Each user has a profile for all their saved boards, and can add other
users as collaborators. We also used Socket.IO for the live collaboration feature, where users can chat with eachother in real time as well as see other changes 
made by other users on the board. 

## Reflections: 
This project challenged me and my team members to learn two new libraries in a short amount of time: KonvaJS and Socket.IO. This was also the first real
application we built from the ground up with React and Express. It was challenging to implement the save feature, as we needed a way to have every item on the board
save properly into our database.
