## Origin: 
"Fun with AI" was created as part of the front end developer intern challenge required for Shopify's intern application.

## Task: 
The task was to create a form to enter prompts that would fetch reponses from the <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank">OpenAI API</a>.
Results would then have to be displayed in a list from newest to oldest, with the original prompt and the API's response.

## Reflections: 
This project allowed me to refresh my skills on fetching information from an API. The OpenAI API is incredibly versatile and intelligent, seeing the API responses
was a joy to play around with. As an extension of the project and to showcase my passion with design, I designed my iteration of this challenge to my liking. 
I created an SVG image using Figma to use to make the app a little more personalized and cute!
